# Predicting Bounding Boxes

- I'll build a model to predict bounding boxes around images.  
- You will use transfer learning on any of the pre-trained models available in Keras. 
- You'll be using the [Caltech Birds - 2010](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/visipedia/CUB-200.html) dataset and evaluate performance using IoU.
